Progress from last week:  
-[x] Most of the parameters are read in from JSON (had to convert from unicode)  
-[x] Learned mesh generation (first mesh finished, need to speak to Hossein about one step)  
-[x] Worked on fenics script organization  
    -[x] Learned github issue functionality  
    - Code is functional for three-state sensitivity  
    - Moving forward, need to switch from specifying cardiac period and number of cycles to just specifying a simulation duration (makes code general, helps with optimizing passive parameters to end diastole)  
-[x] First pass at reviewing paper  
-[x] Worked on revisions to three state manuscript  

Goals for next week:  
-[ ] Add all "feature tracking" to github issue tracker  
-[ ] Investigate Github project planning capability  
-[ ] Build all meshes for three state sensitivity  
-[ ] Update all documentation  
-[ ] Have made significant progress on coding optimization framework  
-[ ] Significant progress on three state revisions  
-[ ] Finish paper review  
-[ ] Start thinking about calcium transient for sensitivity paper  
  
Questions:  
* Hossein: can you help me with the transform world matrix mesh generation step?  
* General: Tuning Windkessel parameters?
