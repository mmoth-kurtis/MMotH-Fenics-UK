Overview
========

MMotH-Vent relies on user-specified information in the form of instruction files. These instruction files use the JSON format and define dictionaries of information to be parsed. Note, the convention is for input values to be specified as elements of a list, e.g. "keyword": [value] rather than "keyword": value. This page gives an overview of the expected keywords of an instruction file and their options. Examples of instruction files for different geometries and simulations are provided that correspond to the demos.
