Summary
-------
A unit cube mesh consisting of six tetrahedral elements is used to model a single muscle cell tension response to a twitch calcium transient. The instruction file is included in the repository, and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/mmoth-kurtis/MMotH-Vent/blob/master/demos/cell_isometric_twitch_demo/cell_isometric_twitch_demo.json" >here (fix download).</a>

Simulation Protocol
-------------------
The muscle cell is stretched 11.5% over 5 ms so that the half-sarcomere length increases from 950 nm to 1100 nm. This stretch is maintained for 15 ms at a calcium concentration of 1e-7 M to allow the cross-bridges to reach steady state. Then the cell is activated with a skeletal muscle calcium transient approximation from (citation) using the [two-compartment calcium](../../../model_formulations/calcium_models/two_compartment_model/two_compartment_model.md) model, and stretch held fixed.

Boundary Conditions & Assumptions
---------------------------------
- Left face displacement is fixed in the x-direction.
- Right face displacement is prescribed to give the desired magnitude of stretch.
- A single point on the left face is completely fixed to prevent rigid body translation.
- The edges on the ends are fixed in either y or z to allow expansion/compression due to incompressibility while keeping the cross-section area square and prevent rigid-body rotation.

Visualizing Results
-------------------
Two types of output are given by the simulations: cell level results and system level results. The cell level results include information needed for and calculated by MyoSim, and can be visualized by executing  
```
python /home/fenics/shared/plot_tools/k_plotter_npy.py 0 0
```
from the output directory. Below is a video of the plots generated by k_plotter_npy.py:

And the cube deformation is seen in Paraview, shown below. The color shows the magnitude of active stress generated in the f0 direction (the direction shown by the vectors in the bottom image):
