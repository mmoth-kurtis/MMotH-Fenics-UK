Summary
-------
A muscle fiber twitch simulation. A cylinder geometry in which the ends represent non-contracting, fibrous tissue with a nonlinear stiffness and the quadrature points represent contracting myofibrils.  

Simulation Protocol
-------------------
The right end of the fiber is displaced to the right 14% over 5 ms to induce a passive stress response. This stretch is maintained for 10 ms at a calcium concentration of 1e-7 M to allow the cross-bridges to reach steady state. Then the cell is activated with a skeletal muscle calcium transient approximation [1^] using the [two-compartment calcium](../../../model_formulations/calcium_models/two_compartment_model/two_compartment_model.md) model, and stretch held fixed, allowing the myofibrils to contract against the compliance at either end. The contractile parameters are tuned to match twitch stress data from literature[2]

Boundary Conditions & Assumptions
---------------------------------
- Left face displacement is fixed in the x-direction.
- Notes on the left fact on the y and z-axes are constrained to remain on those axes to prevent rigid body rotation and translation
- Right face displacement is prescribed to give the desired magnitude of stretch.
- The material is incompressible.
- All myofibril active stress is along the long-axis.
