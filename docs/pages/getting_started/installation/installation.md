Currently, Docker is required to run MMotH-Vent. Docker is a program that creates "containers" that allows code to be run in a controlled environment using the host computer's resources. A switch from Docker to Singularity may be made in the future to allow the code to be executed on a computing cluster. To get started, follow these steps (Note, command line text can be copied and pasted into a terminal, but items in [] need to be replaced with user specific information):  
  * [Install Docker](#install-docker)
  * [Clone Repository](#clone-the-mmoth-vent-repository)
  * [Load Image](#load-image)
  * [Create Container](#create-container)
  * [Enter Container Command Line](#enter-container-command-line)

## Install Docker
Install the latest version of [Docker](http://www.docker.com).

## Clone the MMoth-Vent Repository
All of the source code to run MMotH-Vent is located on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmoth-kurtis/MMotH-Fenics-UK.git). Users experienced with Git can do this through a command line approach. Otherwise, a .zip file from the repository can be downloaded. Unzip the file in the desired directory.

## Load Image  
A Docker image is a copy of the environment used to execute the code. This allows standardization of the modules and their versions used by MMoth-Vent. The image that needs to be loaded by Docker ~~is in the MMotH-Fenics-UK repository, saved as ```MMotH-Vent.tar```~~. *We need a way to distribute this outside of our lab* From the command line, with Docker running, navigate to where this file is saved on your machine, and execute the following:  
```
docker load < MMotH-Vent.tar
```
Note, this step takes time. Once the step is complete, execute:
```
docker images
```
to check that the ```MMotH-Vent``` image has been loaded correctly.


## Create Container
Once Docker has loaded the image, a container can be created in which MMoth-Vent will be executed. To access the cloned repository, the directory containing MMotH-Vent source code needs to be shared with the container. To create the container, and mount the directory to be shared, execute the following at the command line:  
```
sudo docker run -it --mount src=[/path_to_MMotH-Vent_directory_on_machine],target=/home/fenics/shared/,type=bind [image_name]
```
The directory structure within the new container is  
```
/home/  
|  +-- fenics/  
|  |  +-- demo/  
|  |  +-- local/  
|  |  +-- shared/  
```
and the contents of the MMotH-Vent repository will be located under the ```shared``` directory.  
Verify that the container has been created by executing the following at the command line:
```
docker ps -a
```
This displays a list of all containers created on the local machine.

Once the container has been created, it needs to be started. Using "Container ID" from the previous command,
```
docker start [CONTAINER_ID]
```

## Enter Container Command Line
Now that the container is started, the following command takes the user to a command line within the container to execute the MMotH code. Replace CONTAINER_NAME with the name of the container as seen from the ```docker ps -a``` command.
```
sudo docker exec -ti -u fenics [CONTAINER_NAME] /bin/bash -l
```
It is recommended to create an alias shortcut to issue this command regularly. Once the container is created from the image, the regular workflow to use MMotH-Vent is:
* Start Docker
* From the command line, start the created container using ```docker start [CONTAINER_ID]```
* Enter the command line in the container using ```sudo docker exec -ti -u fenics [CONTAINER_NAME] /bin/bash -l```.
* When finished, exit the container by issuing the ```exit``` command.
