# Installing

Currently, [Docker](http://www.docker.com) is required to run FEniCS. Docker is a program that creates "containers" that allows code to be run in a controlled environment using the host container resources. Make sure Docker is installed. The steps for installation are as follows:  
  * Install Docker  
  * Load the MMotH-Fenics-UK [image]
  * Create a Docker container with the loaded image
  *
