MMotH-Vent is a multi-scale finite-element solver that simulates left ventricular mechanics. Specifically, MMotH-Vent simulates cardiac cycles by coupling a cross-bridge kinetics model to a myocardial tissue constitutive law and circulatory model. More information about each model formulation can be found [here](/MMotH-Vent/model_formulation/model_formulations/).
